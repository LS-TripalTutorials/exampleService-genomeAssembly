This tutorial and associated documentation will teach you how to create a Tripal service and use dependency injection to make the new Tripal DBX Chado database connection available within your code.

The tutorial will walk you through a hands-on example with code samples and short explanations guiding you through. The service created in the example is focused on providing access to genome assemblies stored in Chado using best practices.

In the left sidebar you will also notice an "Explanations" section which will describe more in depth what a service is, when you will want to use one and what I mean by dependency injection. These are provided to help you guide you to deeper understanding beyond the code given in the tutorial. It is separated out to keep the hands-on tutorial leaner and less overwhelming.
